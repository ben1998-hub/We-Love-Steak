            <h2>How to cook a steak</h2>

            <p>Start by selecting a high-quality steak, such as ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon.
               Allow the steak to come to room temperature by taking it out of the refrigerator for about 30 minutes
                before cooking.
                Preheat your grill or stovetop pan to high heat.
              Season the steak with salt and pepper, or any other desired seasonings.
                 If using a grill, oil the grates to prevent sticking. If using a stovetop pan, add a small amount of
                oil
                or butter to the pan.
                 Place the steak on the grill or in the pan and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side for
                medium-rare,
                adjusting the time based on your desired level of doneness.
                 Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. For medium-rare, it should be around 34Â°C.
                 Once cooked to your liking, remove the steak from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes to allow
                the
                juices to redistribute.
                 Slice the steak against the grain and serve.</p>

            <h2>Diffrent types of steaks</h2>
            <p> Ribeye: This steak is known for its rich marbling, which gives it a tender and flavorful taste. It is
                cut from the rib section of the cow and is often considered one of the juiciest and most flavorful cuts.

                 Filet Mignon: This steak is cut from the tenderloin, a muscle that doesn't do much work, resulting in
                a very tender and buttery texture. It is known for its mild flavor and is often considered one of the
                most tender cuts of beef.

                 New York Strip: Also known as a strip steak or a sirloin steak, this cut comes from the short loin
                section of the cow. It has a good amount of marbling, which adds flavor, and a slightly firmer texture
                compared to a ribeye. It is known for its balance of tenderness and flavor.

                 T-Bone: This steak is named after its T-shaped bone, which separates two different cuts of beef: the
                tenderloin and the strip steak. It offers the best of both worlds, with the tenderness of the filet
                mignon on one side of the bone and the flavor of the New York strip on the other side.

                 Porterhouse: Similar to the T-bone steak, the porterhouse steak also contains both the tenderloin and
                the strip steak, but in larger portions. It is often considered a larger version of the T-bone steak and
                is known for its generous size and rich flavor.

                These are just a few examples of different types of steaks, each with its own unique qualities. It's
                worth exploring and trying different cuts to find your personal preference in terms of tenderness,
                flavor, and marbling.
