## UX

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘  ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘
## The desgin process 
Design process for We Love Steak is ablend of creativity, strategy, and technology. Here's a breakdown of how we turn juicy ideas into sizzling desings!

## Empathize
**Understanding the users**: I started by immersing myself in the world of steak to understand the user desires, needs and challenges in getting a good steak.

### Colour Scheme
The color scheme for We Love Steak. Features black, red, dark gray, and blue. This palette was chosen to crate a visually striking and engaging experience.black offers a classic,readdable base, while the vibrant red serves as a bold highlight, drawing attention to key elements. Dark gray provides a soft contrast for secondary information, and blue adds a cool, refreshing tone. Together, these colors balance virancy with visual appeal of We Love Steak.

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘



I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P =Primary | S =Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```
ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘
### Typography



- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

# Testing



## Code Validation



Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site pages, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live pages (each of them) using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fben1998-hub.github.io%2FWe-Love-Steak%2Findex.html

Sample HTML code validation documentation (tables are extremely helpful!):

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live site if you only have a single CSS file using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to the page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fben1998-hub.github.io%2FWe-Love-Steak

If you have multiple CSS files, then individual [validation by input](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
is recommended for the additional CSS files.

**IMPORTANT**: Third-Party tools

If you're using extras like Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, then sometimes the validator
will attempt to also validate this code, even if it's not part of your own actual code.
You are not required to validate the external libraries or frameworks!

## Browser Compatibility

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Sample browser testing documentation:

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

## Responsiveness

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have ,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

This section is primarily used for JavaScript and Python applications,
but feel free to use this section to document any HTML/CSS bugs you might run into.

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

## Unfixed Bugs

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
