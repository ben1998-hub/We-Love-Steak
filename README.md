-I would also like to say I would write the README.md and the TESTING.md through out the project and not leave it all to the end.
-The most important things for me now wouldn't be some much about the code it's self but more about planing, order and structure when  building a project.
-I did think until I got to this point it was all about the code if I could go back I would do the things above way more and better!
-I'd like to thank code instuide for this opportunitty it's been such a learning curve thank you.
