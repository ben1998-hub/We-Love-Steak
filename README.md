Design process for We Love Steak is ablend of creativity, strategy, and technology. Here's a breakdown of how we turn juicy ideas into sizzling desings!

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘



I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P =Primary | S =Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```

Use this space to provide attribution links to any images, videos, or audio files borrowed from online.
A few examples have been provided below to give you some ideas.

If you're the owner (or a close acquaintance) of all media files, then make sure to specify this.
Let the assessors know that you have explicit rights to use the media files within your project.

Ideally, you should provide an actual link to every media file used, not just a generic link to the main site!
The list below is by no means exhaustive. Within the Code Institute Slack community, you can find more "free media" links
by sending yourself the following command: `!freemedia`.

## Bugs

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

This section is primarily used for JavaScript and Python applications,
but feel free to use this section to document any HTML/CSS bugs you might run into.

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

- JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.


## Unfixed Bugs

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
