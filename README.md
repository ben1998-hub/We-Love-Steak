## UX


## The desgin process 
Design process for We Love Steak is ablend of creativity, strategy, and technology. Here's a breakdown of how we turn juicy ideas into sizzling desings!

## Empathize
**Understanding the users**: I started by immersing myself in the world of steak to understand the user desires, needs and challenges in getting a good steak.



### Colour Scheme
The color scheme for We Love Steak. Features black, red, dark gray, and blue. This palette was chosen to crate a visually striking and engaging experience.black offers a classic,readdable base, while the vibrant red serves as a bold highlight, drawing attention to key elements. Dark gray provides a soft contrast for secondary information, and blue adds a cool, refreshing tone. Together, these colors balance virancy with visual appeal of We Love Steak. 



- `#F31313` used for primary text.
- `#FFF` used for primary highlights.
- `#333` used for secondary text.
- `#45a149` used for secondary highlights.


I used this link to show the main colour's
https://coolors.co/generate
![screenshoot](documentation/color.scheme.png)
When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:


I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

If you've used CSS `:root` variables, consider also including a code snippet here!

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P = Primary | S = Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```

### Typography
